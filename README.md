# Taoshiflex Studio

The commercial website and project platform for Taoshiflex Studio — a founder-led web design and development studio serving ambitious businesses in Bangladesh first, with an international-ready foundation.

## Architecture

- Next.js 16 App Router + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 plus a custom brand design system
- Motion for restrained, accessible animation
- Supabase Postgres for projects, services, inquiries, and settings
- Supabase Auth for the private studio manager
- Supabase Storage for project media
- Row Level Security for public/private content separation

Phase 1 is a complete public experience backed by curated typed local content. Supabase is an intentionally disconnected future foundation; the public site and project brief require no credentials.

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Run `npm run dev`

Optional future data setup is documented in `docs/supabase-foundation.md` and `supabase/migrations/202608300001_public_foundation.sql`.

## Useful scripts

- `npm run dev` — local development
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run the production build

## Content model

Projects support a client/business name, service name, category, status, public/private visibility, case-study copy, repository URL, live URL, images, tags, and ordering. Inquiries are stored separately and are visible only to authenticated studio admins.

## Product direction

The public experience is organized around four conversion jobs:

1. Establish trust quickly.
2. Show a small number of strong, honestly labeled projects.
3. Explain how the studio works and who Gazi Taoshif is.
4. Make starting a qualified project simple.
